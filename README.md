### Pixelated Fedora logo w/ Silverblue!  
  
Just a quick project I was inspired to make happen. Simply made a pixelated version of the Fedora and the Silverblue logo with GIMP (I might to an SVG at a later time). Along with the logos (made in 2K quality), I made some example wallpapers and upscaled them using Waifu2x to a 4K compatible resolution.
